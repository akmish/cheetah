## Motivation

The motivation is to provide a capability for automated testing of software developed at MBFS.  This is one objective to be achieved on the road to producing quality software products in an organization that is embracing the agile methodology.  The road to automation will require skillful navigation, since our route is uncharted. Daimler has built an autonomous drive vehicle. MBFS will implement automated software testing.
